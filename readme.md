A simple spring boot client to send an application to gepardec, using REST services.

You would need to switch the CV with your personal one and enter your personal information into the application.yml file.
(You can also add other fields like title, otherSource, or whatever you need)
Then run the application, provide an answer to the question, then you get a resumee of what will get sent,
then confirm with entering "y" and your data should get sent.
